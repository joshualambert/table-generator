HOWTO:

To use this code, simply upload to any PHP compatible server, and make sure that the list.txt file is in the
same folder with the PHP script running it. By default, the script file is named "index.php", though you'll
probably want to change this for your personal setup.

List.TXT Template:
I Longed To Gather You|Roger Kirkpatrick
Systematic Theology|Louis Berkhof
Poems for Patriarchs|Doug Philips

The delimiter for the second column is the |. If you want to add additional columns, simply add another pipe
to the list.txt before each new column, and in index.php, tweak the table to add in your additional fields.

Enjoy the script!
